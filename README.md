hi!

I am ALWAYS open to interaction, dont hesitate to come up to me and start a conversation I do have very bad anxiety and its hard for me to approch people so I would prefer if you came up to me </3 . . .

Dont be shy!!! I love when people come and sit next to me!!! :3c




I rarely change any of these but i'll still put this here

🟢 - feel free to talk to me

🌙 - pretty much always on idle, that doesnt mean im afk though, you have about a 50/50 chance of catching me. . just shoot me a whisper if I don't respond when you come up to me

⛔ - I never use this lowkey
